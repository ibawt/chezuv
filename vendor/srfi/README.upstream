Scheme Requests for Implementation (SRFIs), as R6RS libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------

The libraries' names conform to SRFI 97: SRFI Libraries.  There is a registry of
available SRFIs and other platform features which works alongside SRFI 0:
Feature-Based Conditional Expansion.  The porting done so far is mostly just
taking the reference implementations from http://srfi.schemers.org and wrapping
them in libraries and tweaking the few things needed to make them work in R6RS
libraries and with implementations' functionality.  Supporting any R6RS
implementation supporting the *.IMPL.sls convention is easy.

These SRFIs are available:
  (srfi :0 cond-expand)
  (srfi :1 lists)
  (srfi :2 and-let*)
  (srfi :4 numeric-vectors)
  (srfi :5 let)
  (srfi :6 basic-string-ports)
  (srfi :8 receive)
  (srfi :9 records)
  (srfi :11 let-values)
  (srfi :13 strings)
  (srfi :14 char-sets)
  (srfi :16 case-lambda)
  (srfi :17 generalized-set!)
  (srfi :19 time)
  (srfi :23 error)
  (srfi :25 multi-dimensional-arrays)
  (srfi :26 cut)
  (srfi :27 random-bits)
  (srfi :28 basic-format-strings)
  (srfi :29 localization)
  (srfi :31 rec)
  (srfi :34 exception-handling)
  (srfi :35 conditions)
  (srfi :37 args-fold)
  (srfi :38 with-shared-structure)
  (srfi :39 parameters)
  (srfi :41 streams)
  (srfi :42 eager-comprehensions)
  (srfi :43 vectors)
  (srfi :45 lazy)
  (srfi :48 intermediate-format-strings)
  (srfi :51 rest-values)
  (srfi :54 cat)
  (srfi :60 integer-bits)
  (srfi :61 cond)
  (srfi :64 testing)
  (srfi :67 compare-procedures)
  (srfi :69 basic-hash-tables)
  (srfi :78 lightweight-testing)
  (srfi :98 os-environment-variables)
  (srfi :99 records)
  (srfi :115 regex)
  (srfi :117 list-queues)
  (srfi :125 hashtables)
  (srfi :126 r6rs-hashtables)
  (srfi :127 lazy-sequences)
  (srfi :128 comparators)
  (srfi :129 titlecase)
  (srfi :130 string-cursors)
  (srfi :131 records)
  (srfi :132 sorting)
  (srfi :133 vectors)
  (srfi :141 integer-division)
  (srfi :143 fixnums)
  (srfi :145 assumptions)
  (srfi :151 bitwise-operations)
  (srfi :152 strings)
  (srfi :156 predicate-combiners)
  (srfi :158 generators-and-accumulators)

Other SRFIs are not available because there hasn't been a demand for them or
they're not possible as an R6RS library.  If you already have ported SRFIs to
R6RS, we'd love to assimilate them.  You can let us know by "asking a question"
at the Scheme Libraries project page:

  https://launchpad.net/scheme-libraries

Currently supported systems are Chez Scheme, Ikarus, Larceny, and Ypsilon.
PLT Scheme is only semi-supported because it has its own "srfi" directory
which conflicts with having another "srfi" directory; you can symlink/copy
files from this collection into PLT's "srfi" directory.
